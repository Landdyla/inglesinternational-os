      instructions in the offer of the Program.

   2. Basic Permissions.

      You are granted the following permissions provided that you
      conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy of the
      Program, in a manner suitable to the medium, a notice
      acknowledging that you have received the Program under the terms
      of this License, and that you make no representation otherwise:

      1. You may make and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
         Source code, as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
         you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
         acknowledgment that you have received the Program under the
         terms of this License, and that you make no representation
         otherwise.

      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
         portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications or
         portions, in any medium, provided that you meet the following
         conditions:

         1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you have changed the files.

         2. You must include in any distribution of the modified
            Program a copy of this License; and

         3. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
            and to the absence of any warranty; and

         4. If the modified Program includes a facility for
            interactive user support, you must make reasonable efforts
            to ensure that the interface indicates that the user is
            operating under a modified version of the Program.

   3. Copyleft.

      You are not allowed to impose any further restrictions on the
      rights granted by this License.  For example, you may not
      impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of

      legal remedies to enforce any such further restrictions.

      is not covered by this License.

   5. Aggregation with Independent Works.

      You may aggregate the Program with other independent works
      and distribute the aggregate as a single package, provided that
      the copyright notice for the Program is not removed.

   6. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications
      to the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
      this License, provided that you include a prominent and
      appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; and

      warranty; and that you keep intact all notices that refer to
      this License and to the absence of any warranty.

   8. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

      Each time you convey the Program, or a work based on the
      Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from
      the original licensors to run, modify and propagate the
      Program subject to these terms and conditions.

   9. No Additional Restrictions.

      You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights
      granted by this License.

      but has received a copy of the Program, is not required to
      comply with this License.

   11. Termination.

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by you of the terms of this
      License.  Individuals or organizations who have received
      copies, modified or unmodified, of the Program from you
      are not affected by the termination of this License,
      provided that such individuals or organizations remain in
      compliance with these terms and conditions.

      WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
      MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PROVIDED, BE LIABLE TO
      YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
      free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

      To do so, you must include a copy of this license document and make
      sure that everyone else also receives a copy.  If your program is
      interactive and uses a screen, make it display this license notice
      and the copyright notice in a prominent place, like the title screen
      or the help screen.

      Be sure to save all the changeable parts of the template you just
      read, and replace them with the appropriate information.

      The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
      program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
      library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
      applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
      the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.
   distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
   limitations under the License.
